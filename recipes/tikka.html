    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This Indian dish is traditionally cooked in a clay oven, but works on the barbecue too- try with homemade tamarind chutney and herb salad</p>
    <h2>The ingredients required:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>640 g chicken fillets</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 handful baby leaf spinach</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tikka paste</li>
        <li>1 courgette, grated</li>
        <li>1 tbsp plain flour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp mango chutney</li>
        <li>1 handful breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>30 g fresh coriander</li>
        <li>8 wholewheat flour tortillas</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The steps required:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First thing to do is line a baking tray with greaseproof paper. Grate half a courgette, add a little salt then place into a sieve over a bowl and set aside while you prep the rest. This will help to draw out the moisture.</li>
        <li>Now place a thick slice of bread into a food processor whizz until you get breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Next add 2 garlic cloves and 1 onion very roughly chopped. Then add the following: 6 chicken thighs, tikka curry paste, 1 handful fresh coriander and season.</li>
        <li>Add the grated courgette and a handful of thawed spinach, making sure you squeeze out any excess liquid. The mixture will be quite wet anyway so make sure you squeeze as much liquid out as possible.</li>
        <li>Finally, add the flour and whizz this all up until you have a relatively smooth mixture.</li>
        <li>Once everything has been combined, wet your hands (which will make it easier to mould the burgers) then take a handful of the mixture. Form the burger patties then place them on your lined baking tray. Keep in the fridge for half an hour to firm them up.</li>
        <li>Add a little oil to a large frying pan and set over a medium heat. Fry the burgers until they are browned on either side and make sure that they are cooked through, so that no pink remains.</li>
        <li>Now you can wrap it all into your tortilla wrap. So grab yourself a tortilla, place some ribboned cucumber, a dollop of yogurt and mango chutney near the top centre of the wrap then place your burger on top, add some extra fresh coriander and then wrap and enjoy! Serve with sweet potato wedges and salad.</li>
