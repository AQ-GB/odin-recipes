        <br>
        <h2>The ingredients required:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>125g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>100g plain flour</li>
            <li>100g rye flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp sea salt flakes, plus extra for sprinkling</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>Â¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
            <li>200g light brown soft sugar</li>
            <li>100g golden caster sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg, plus 2 large yolks</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>200g chocolate, chopped into small chunks (choose dark or milk, or a mixture of the two)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The steps required:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter in a small saucepan until sizzling. Watch it carefully - the butter will foam, and, when the foam subsides, it will turn from yellow to a hazelnut brown. At this point, remove from the heat, tip into a bowl and leave to cool. Meanwhile, mix the flours, salt, baking powder and bicarb together in a bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>When the butter is cool, tip in the sugars and beat with a wooden spoon to combine. Add the egg, yolks and vanilla and beat together. Scrape the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until it all comes together into a dough. Fold in the chocolate, then chill for at least 3 hrs, or until firm. Will keep chilled for up to 24 hrs.</li>
            <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line two large baking sheets with baking parchment. Separate the dough into 12 pieces, weighing for accuracy if you like. Roll each piece into a ball using your hands, then put six balls on each sheet, leaving space between them for spreading. Bake for 10 mins, then, one sheet at a time, remove from the oven, sprinkle with some sea salt and slam the sheet hard against your work surface.</li>
            <li>Bake for another 3 mins, then repeat the slamming of the sheet. Bake for 3 mins more. This timing will give you soft cookies, but if you prefer them a bit firmer, cook for a few minutes longer. Leave to cool on the sheets for 10 mins before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
